                <P>Hello everyone, I am Sabelo K. Mpungose, 26 years old, I live in Newcastle, Kwa-Zulu Natal(South Africa). I am single and currently doing part time jobs.
                    My favorite pass times are listening to music, watching movies and playing video games. As I am sure you can see, I am a fairly introverted person but I am always happy to meet new people.
                     am excited to begin this class with all of you.
                </P>
